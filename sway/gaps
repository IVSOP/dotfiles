# "borrowed" from

# Set inner/outer gaps
gaps inner 5
gaps outer 0

# Additionally, you can issue commands with the following syntax. This is useful to bind keys to changing the gap size.
# gaps inner|outer current|all set|plus|minus <px>
# gaps inner all set 10
# gaps outer all plus 5

# Smart gaps (gaps used if only more than one container on the workspace)
smart_gaps on

# Smart borders (draw borders around container only if it is not the only container on this workspace)
# on|no_gaps (on=always activate and no_gaps=only activate if the gap size to the edge of the screen is 0)
#smart_borders no_gaps
#this used to work, now it glitches????

# Hide edge borders only if there is one window with no gaps
# hide_edge_borders smart_no_gaps

# Press $mod+Shift+g to enter the gap mode. Choose o or i for modifying outer/inner gaps. Press one of + / - (in-/decrement for current workspace) or 0 (remove gaps for current workspace). If you also press Shift with these keys, the change will be global for all workspaces.
set $mode_gaps Gaps: (o) outer, (i) inner
set $mode_gaps_outer Outer Gaps: +|-|0 (local), Shift + +|-|0 (global)
set $mode_gaps_inner Inner Gaps: +|-|0 (local), Shift + +|-|0 (global)
